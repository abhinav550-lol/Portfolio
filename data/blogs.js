			Hey everyone, I’m Abhinav Mishra, and being part of this journey has been nothing short of surreal.

			When we received our problem statement — not just outside our top preferences but literally at the bottom — our first reaction was a collective “Oh no…”. But what followed was pure magic: late-night hustle, nonstop brainstorming, and an unwavering drive to turn things around.
			We partnered with Reaching Roots Foundation, an NGO focused on empowering rural communities through agriculture and grassroots entrepreneurship. Their biggest challenge? Structuring and digitizing workflows involving village-level entrepreneurs (VLEs) and volunteers — especially in low-connectivity areas.

			So, we got to work and built something real.
			💡 Key highlights of our solution:
			🔐 Role-Based Authentication for managing permissions across different user types
			🌐 IndexedDB Queuing System to support offline-first data entry and seamless syncing
			📄 Computer Vision Module to digitize handwritten and printed documents
			🤖 AI Chatbot for intuitive data access and guidance
			📊 ML-Based Ranking System to track VLE and village performance
			🛠️ Interactive Dashboards, Backend Utilities, and Smart Integrations

			But beyond the tech, it was the experience that made this unforgettable — the caffeine-fueled nights, the chaos, the creativity, and yes… my legendary terrible jokes that somehow landed 😅

			Huge thanks to our mentors — Vivek Rachamalla ,Venkat ,Suresh Chamantula Gnanasundar (Satish) Patnaik, D Sankirth Reddy — for their incredible support and guidance throughout.

			And of course, major shoutout to my amazing team:
			Tanoj Rahul Reddy, Sai Prakash Avula, Yamuna Latchipatruni,Rishitha Chenigarapu, Harshitha Kancheti, Sravan Pudi and yours truly 😄

			🏅 As if winning wasn’t exciting enough, we also walked away with an iPad + Apple Pencil — definitely the sweetest cherry on top 🍒🙌
			This experience was about more than just code — it was about collaboration, impact, and growth.

			Huge thanks to JPMorganChase for organizing such a meaningful event. Here’s to solving real problems, learning endlessly, and always staying hungry — for food and knowledge 😄
